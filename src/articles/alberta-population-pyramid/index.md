A couple of observations. First, from 1975 until recently, its been all about the Baby Boomers. They have really dominated demographically.

But look at the last few years. Alberta attracts a lot of workers, most of whom are relatively young. As of 2012, 25-35 year olds outnumber 45-55 year olds.

Times have changed.
